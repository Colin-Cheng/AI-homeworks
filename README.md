* **Lights Out puzzle Game:**
You can play the Lights Out puzzle Game by running `python homework2_lights_out_gui.py rows cols` in the command line(The arguments `rows` and `cols` are positive integers designating the size of the puzzle). The goal of the puzzle is to turn all the lights off, with the caveat that whenever a light is toggled, its
neighbors above, below, to the left, and to the right will be toggled as well.

### HW3: Informed Search(A* search)

You can play the Tile Puzzle Game by running `python homework3_tile_puzzle_gui.py rows cols` in the command line(The arguments `rows` and `cols` are positive integers designating the size of the board). The Tile Puzzle consists of a board of sliding tiles with a single empty space. For each configuration, the only possible moves are to swap the empty tile with one of its neighboring tiles. The goal is to make the puzzle consists of ordered numbers in each cells, with the empty space in the lower-right corner.

* **Dominoes Game:**
You can play the Dominoes Game by running `python homework3_dominoes_game_gui.py rows cols` in the command line(The arguments `rows` and `cols` are positive integers designating the size of the board). The Dominoes Game has two players, who take turns placing 1 x 2 dominoes on a rectangular grid. One player must always place his dominoes vertically, and the other must always place his dominoes horizontally. The last player who successfully places a domino on the board wins.
